Have you ever caught yourself navigating a website in search of an item you were looking to purchase only to be discouraged and frustrated with the lack of direction on the website? Of course, this could be attributed to a user experience or terrible website design, but this problem can be fixed with the ideal web framework, i.e., Shopify or Woo Commerce. However, there is another key concept that seems to fly over many developers’ and designers’ heads, and that’s platform messaging.

## Why is medium content valuable for your business, and how can you use Social Media Marketing to build a high converting sales funnel?

Everything on your website should serve a purpose. If you are searching to maximize your marketing efforts, you’ll need an easy-to-navigate website. Suppose that you are served with an advertisement using the latest tools in ad automation to target your interests. Leads you to their website only to have second thoughts after the 30-second load-up screen or the poor image quality of the product. However, you muster on and arrive at the check-out form. The checkout form is asking you for tons of information that you might not already have on hand. At this point, you might decide you no longer want the product. This final drop-off could be avoided by strategically placing content using social media marketing.

Social media marketing experts have cultivated strategies that suggest that having purposeful social marketing messages prevent drop-offs from occurring in your website’s sales funnel. A powerful strategy is optimizing your social media outreach to lead those consumers to your website’s sales funnel. Once buyers have arrived, the aim is to keep them from dropping off. Like the social media messaging that led those clients to your website, you want to carry those consumers to their intended destination, whether that be generating leads or sales.
