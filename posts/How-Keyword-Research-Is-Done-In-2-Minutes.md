## Motivation

Google’s search engine matches keywords to their pages using relevancy and popularity signals across billions of pages.

## Choosing the correct keywords to generate more sales

Here are some ideas I encountered while researching keywords for search engine optimization (SEO). Consider the concept of cost-per-click while undertaking keyword research. Keywords that are more popular and relevant tend to produce more searches, resulting in greater associated expenses. Furthermore, some keyword SEO tools, such as [Ubersuggest](https://bit.ly/3GpoD3a) or [SEMRush Magic Keyword Tool](https://bit.ly/3LP0bck), show where businesses rank for specific keywords. Knowing which keywords have the highest CPC also allows consumers to see how many competitors are bidding on those keywords. However, finding the proper term for your target demographic requires extra attention.

Users are stunting their business’s growth by not properly aligning their keywords with their intended audience. Small business owners, on the other hand, can experience a rise in sales over time with a little keyword research. Understanding a target audience’s problem and how your product or service can help them will make choosing the right keyword search terms much easier. If you sell construction and safety tools, for example, your keyword ad dollars might be better spent targeting handymen or construction workers rather than software developers. The trick is to find relevant keywords that relate to those handymen or construction professionals.


## Bottomline

The most valuable takeaway I learned from keyword research is that spending a little time researching suitable keywords and identifying your business’s target audience will help you achieve your objectives.

Moreover, setting time aside to use keyword optimization tools and matching relevant phrases with a business’s target audience can contribute to business growth.
