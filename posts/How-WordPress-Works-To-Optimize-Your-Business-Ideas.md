## WordPress is free — Who doesn’t enjoy free software

Getting started with WordPress is free and open-source, meaning you can use and modify it to meet your business needs. There is an abundance of blogs, how-to videos, and online courses you can take to get started. Keep in mind that obtaining a domain name and web hosting for your website can be done through a service provided of your choice. I suggest [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/) for many of my small business owner clients, as it provides them with a variety of hosting capacities to meet their business needs.

## Learning WordPress is easy

WordPress is extremely easy to pick up and get started. Unlike many other content management systems (CMS) that require a vast understanding of their different features, the WordPress team has created a unique UI for its users to grasp right out the gate. Take their sidebar, for instance. You’ll notice how the different utilities are well defined to get you what you want. Do you want to post an article? Then click on ‘Posts’. It’s that easy.

## WordPress is multifaceted.

WordPress made its CMS with the vision of getting the everyday web user on its platform. Although that’s not to say it can’t be expanded to power your business, it very much can be with the right customizations set in place.

Purposefully built for bloggers, WordPress’s outreach has grown to capture the world of e-commerce, enabling many small mom-and-pop shops to reach new heights.

## WordPress understands you might NOT be a great designer.

If you haven’t arrived at the realization that you might not be a great designer, but your business is in desperate need of an upgrade to keep up with the latest UI/UX design trends, WordPress has a solution for that. Because WordPress understands its user base, they have a dedicated page builder called [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) that allows for declarative programming, which is a drag-and-drop functionality of components. Over the years, theme building has taken over the WordPress marketplace, so now you can simply hire a professional theme builder at a fair rate.

## WordPress is optimized for SEO.

Today, many small business owners focus their marketing efforts online to stand apart from the competition. We have seen within the last decade a massive shift from traditional forms of marketing to digital marketing. As a result, search engine optimization (SEO) has proven itself as a tool for catapulting businesses to higher ranks on search engines, consequently allowing them to capture a large share of the marketplace. Unlike other web frameworks demanding configuration to meet digital SEO standards, WordPress works out of the box. You can also incorporate SEO plugins that simplify the SEO process, thus giving business owners more time to refine their business strategy.
