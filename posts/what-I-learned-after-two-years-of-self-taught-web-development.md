## Learn The Basics

Okay, okay, you probably skip the lengthy introduction to read the first bold header, and now you're telling yourself, "here we go with another article telling me the same thing I already know." Yes, you might know the routine, but do you stick to it?

Depending on what you're working towards every subject has a baseline, a start point, a beginning, even web development. To me, web development's basics are HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Javascript in that order. Each of those technologies has breadth and depth, so be wary of delving too deep initially. I recommend enrolling in a free online course such as [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which will provide you with a structured start, further giving you the confidence you will need to expand your programming skills.

## Read More Blogs

You wouldn't be here if you didn't already read blogs, but to solidify this idea into the mainstream, consider the issue many front-end developers face when first exposed to CSS, that is, division or section size, padding, border, and margin. Yes, Free Code Camp does an excellent job of teaching you through practical means, but what about the more visual learner who could use a more visual representation or someone who didn't grasp the lesson during their course. Well, I can assure you that multiple articles have already been written on that common CSS issue.

Here's an example, [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/).com has some of the best-written CSS articles.

## Forget About Programming Is Lyfe

I say this because burnout is real. I've known too many developers who have stopped programming for numerous reasons, but one that stands out is burnout. Burnout deserves an article on its own, so expect one in the future. According to the Mayo Clinic job burnout is "work-related stress." This article is mainly for people looking to get started, so many of you won't have a job as a web developer, but if you have a job as a developer and are feeling burned-out, hear me out.

If you can take a break from your projects, do so, else see it through, then take a break, regardless take a break. By separating yourself from the arduous journey encased by programming, not only do you give yourself some peace of mind, but you are also able to remind yourself why you decided to program. No matter the reason, taking a pause will better align your goals in the direction you want to be heading. Whether it's learning some back-end technologies, branching out to UI or UX, or even coming to a realization that you're better suited as a marketing guru, if you don't take the time to pause and relax, then you might miss your next venture.

I'll conclude by saying, know the foundations of your technology, gain a different perspective on things by reading more blogs, and finally, burnout is real, so be cognizant of your well-being.

Also, I'd like to hear what you've learned this far into your web-developer journey.

TL;DR: Know the foundations of your technology, gain a different perspective on things by reading more blogs, and finally, burnout is real, so be cognizant of your well-being.
